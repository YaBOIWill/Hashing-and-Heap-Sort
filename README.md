# Hashing-and-Heap-Sort

1. Write a program to insert the following elements into a hash table of size 17.  The hash function is X mod 17 where X is the input element.  

6, 12, 34, 29, 28, 11, 23, 7, 0, 33, 30, 45

Use linear probing to resolve any collisions. 

 

2. Write a program to implement heapsort. Sort the following elements using your program. 6, 12, 34, 29, 28, 11, 23, 7, 0, 33, 30, 45
